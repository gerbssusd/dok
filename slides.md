# A Study In...

**Planning to focus on key concepts – NOT topics, skills or texts**

- There is no "correct" choice for concept or theme focus

**The study should**
- Support target standards
- Support "big" ideas

---

# Concept Word Wall

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8" mt-20>
<div>

**Post focus themes, concepts, and processes on a wall or bulletin board**

</div>
<div>

- Unit specific words
- Whole discipline words
- Concepts that relate across disciplines

**These key words serve as reminders to the teacher as well as the students.**

</div>
</div>

---

# Essential Questions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-20">
<div>

**Open-ended questions that reflect the big ideas that students should understand**

</div>
<div>

- Serve to "awaken" not "train"
- Abstract and Transferable concepts and processes
- Explored over time
- Responses become more sophisticated
- Big idea → Essential Questions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-40">
<div>
  
## The What

- Leads to deep learning
- Using facts, examples, observations, and experiences to construct undersatandings of important concepts and conceptual relationships.
  
</div>
<div>
  
## The Why

- Stimulates meaning making and leads to deep learning.
- Students can unite ideas under a larger conceptual umbrella
- Prepares students to develop important understandings on their own.

# The How

- Concepts and generalizations from observations and examples
- Uncover conceptual definitions and understandings
- Make relevant thinking processes more accessible through lesson structure and scaffolding

---

# Concept Attainment

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

**Inductive avenue for students to develop their own concept definitions**

</div>
<div>

1. Identify Concept (named either at the beginning OR the end)
2. Develop Yes/No examples
3. Present examples: Students identify what Yes examples have in common AND what the No examples do not share with them
4. Present additional examples: Students test and redefine list of attributes
5. Review examples with students - develop an accurate final list of concept attributes

</div>
</div>

# Yes: Examples of the Concept

# No: Nonexamples

# Concept Definition Map

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

**Helps students understand and gather information necessary to arrive at a concept definition**

</div>
<div>

- Organizes important information visually
- Guides students to collect information about important aspects
- Includes connections to other ideas

</div>
</div>

# A Study In

<div class="text-xs opacity-50 absolute bottom-4">

Da Vinci's Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres

</div>

- Ask students to identify a broader concept or theme that can tie learned information together.
- Have students justify choices with facts and examples
- Be sure to include "Because..."

# Adding Up the Facts

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

**Scaffolds facts leading students to larger concepts, connections and relationships forming big ideas.**

</div>
<div>

- Identify concept
- Generate factual statements that will lead students to understand umbrella concepts
- Provide students with the generated facts
- Ask them what they can conclude by adding up the provided facts

</div>
</div>

# Adding Up The Facts

**Fact A**
**Fact B**
**Fact C**
**Fact D**

# Big T Organizer

**A Good Night's sleep is essential to good health**

- Our bodies heal while we sleep
- Sleep gives us energy to get through each day
- Children need lots of sleep so their bones and muscles can grow.
- Dreams help our brains sort through our memories and thoughts

---

# Connect the Concepts

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

**Helps students understand the relationships between and among concepts**

</div>
<div>

- Ask students to think about the relationship between two or more concepts
- Provide learning experiences and materials that illustrate and allow students to discover the nature of relationships
- Ask students to connect the concepts in a sentence that describes the relationship
- Have students support or further explain relationships using facts and examples from the learning experiences
- Provide opportunities to reexamine and test relationships with new examples and contexts

# Window Notes

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

**Teaches students the difference between copying notes and making notes.**

</div>
<div>

**Students utilize an organizer that helps them collect four sets of notes:**

1. Facts: What are the important facts and details
2. Questions: What questions come to mind? What am I curious about?
3. Connections: How does this relate to my experiences or to other things I have learned?
4. Feelings and Reactions: How do I feel about what I am learning?
